# hangman
Play hangman with your computer! Think of a word, give the computer its length, and it will try to guess your word.

Make sure your word only contains alphabet characters (no hyphens, spaces, colons, etc) and is in this file: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt

Based on the algorithm presented in this video (timestamped at 2:58): https://youtu.be/le5uGqHKll8?t=178

Currently very messy but should technically work.

In the future looking to clean up the code so it's more readable and potentially add a faster/more efficient way to consider all possibilities.

Also definitely looking into making this an actual interface and not a command-line game.
